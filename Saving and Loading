# I need to make sure I can also read into R. 
# So I could choose to save as shapefile. However, apparently some people are not to impressed by the shapefile:

# [...] the agency from which I got the data has been enlightened
# enough not to use the clunky, outdated, and limited "shapefile" format
# and has released the data as a modern, OGC-standard GeoPackage. My
# variables have long names, my metadata is stored with my data, and its
# all in one file instead of six. [...]

# Shapefiles are an awful, awful format which Esri didn't think people
# would actually use. They should not be encouraged. [...]

# Also author of OSMnx package Geoff Boeing says:
# save graph as a geopackage
# you can similarly save it as a shapefile, if you prefer obsolete formats

# Lets do this:
# First I make a polygon for downloading the city of Aalborg the fourth largest city of Denmark.
# To do this I use https://extract.bbbike.org/
