I have to calculate transportation time between some zones in Denmark. Specifically I want to build a multimodal urban network model using primarily Open Street Maps.
My main interest in transportation times is to calculate measure of accessibility such as job-accessibility but also accessibility to other amenities. 

In order to do this I plan to use the road network as provided by Open Street Maps.
