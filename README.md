# Python_and_OSM
I have to calculate transportation time between some zones in Denmark. Specifically I want to build a multimodal urban network model using primarily Open Street Maps (OSM).
My main interest in transportation times is to calculate measures of accessibility such as job-accessibility but also accessibility to other amenities. 

Since I will be learning Python on the fly I plan to use this repository to collect bits of code solving small steps along the way. There is an end goal but no masterplan on how to get there so the small steps are not necessarily well structured.

So I am assuming that travel demand takes the form of someone wanting to go from A to B. Given the desire to go from A to B a routing problem has to be solved to answer: How to get from A to B by travelling along the roads of the network.
